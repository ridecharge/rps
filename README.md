## Rock-Paper-Scissors

**Goal**

Create a web-based application that allows a user to play rock-paper-scissors.

**Estimated Time**

2-3 hours

**Requirements**

- The application should allow a user to choose rock, paper, or scissors
- The application should make a request to the api documented here to retrieve the server’s throw.  Make sure to consider the non happy path cases.

- If the api given above doesn’t work or you’ve run out of time, an alternative is to generate a random throw locally

- The application should respond with a page indicating whether the user won, lost or tied based on the server's throw

**Rules**

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
- Identical throws tie (rock == rock, etc.)
- Extra Credit : What if we threw in Hammer as a choice?  How would you represent more than 3 choices?

**Technologies**

Use any technology that you think best show cases your work.  For example, if you are interviewing for a web application developer position you might use pure javascript, jQuery, React.js, etc.  For a server position you might use Ruby on Rails, Node, Lambdas, Java (if you’re crazy), etc.

**User Interface**

NOTE : This step is Extra Credit for Server developers.

Implement the user interface as shown in this mockup :

The icon assets can be downloaded from the adobe site.

**Deliverable**

Link to a github repo with a readme explaining how to install and play the game.  The repo should include a master branch and a feature branch with a PR.
